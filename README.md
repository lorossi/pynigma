# Pynigma

A modern implementation of the Enigma machine in Python.

## Background

In the past month I have finally managed to see [The Imitation Game](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game), the famous 2014 movie *(yep, it took me a long while)* about Alan Turing and its incredible breaking of the german crypto machine [Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).

Since I was a kid, I have been really fascinated by this machine.
I couldn't understand how it worked, let alone how it was cracked without any kind of computer.

An *electromechanical machine* that was so secure that took years to be decrypted! That can't be true!

So, in order to understand a little bit more how this marvelous machine worked, I decided to try and implement by using the *best programming language ever and ever in the past, present and future or computers* (Python3).

For the first time I actually started using common sense and modern coding recommendations:

1. Type hinting
2. A meaningful and complete testing suite

I have to say, I don't regret this the least.
Making a proper set of tests really helped me a lot.

*Who could have ever imagined that?* Well.

At this point, there's almost more test than code.
*Isn't this how it should work?*
